# CLI Delivery System

This is a CLI implementation of a Delivery System in Python utilizing a Nearest Neighbor algorithm.  

Implements a **HashMap** and **Graph** to plots the points based on input/reading from CSV files.  It will find the closest vertex utilizing the edge weights (distances) and plot a full delivery course before returning back to the Hub.  It follows certain specified limitations (late package arrivals, truck space limitation, etc.), and delivers all packages accordingly.
